			<p>
				The Houtson Rockets were founded in 1967 in San Diego, California before moving to Houston, Texas four years later. 
            In their first season as a franchise, they won 15 games and just two years after that, they made their first playoff
            appearance. The Rockets first trip to the finals came in 1981 where they were eventually deveated by the Celtics in
            6 games. They had to wait another five years to get back to the finals where they lost again to the Celtics. The team
            finally got their big break in 1994 when they won their first championship led by star center Hakeem "The Dream"
            Olajuwon. During the year of their first championship, they also set a franchise record with 58 wins in the season.
