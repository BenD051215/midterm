			<h2 class="shadow">A New Scheme</h2>
			<p>
				With the new system that head coach Mike D'Antoni has put into play, three-point shooting has become an essential role
				for all players on the team. The top three-point shooters on the team may not be known to most people, but they definitely
				play a role in every game they play. These include: Ben McLemore, P.J. Tucker, Jeff Green, and Danuel House Jr. Each of these 
				guys shoot over 40% from behind the arch and help star players like Harden and Westbrook to keep the team winning. The new offensive 
				strategy does not require a center. Therefore, rebounds from long shots are huge in deciding the outcome of a game. Another 
				important aspect to the game is team play and ball movement. These traits are shown on the stat sheet through assists. Some of the 
				best guys on the team, reguarding stats, are shown below.
